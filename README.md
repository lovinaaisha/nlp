# Natural Language Programming

This repo contains small NLP assignments and a mini-project written in pure Python. It covers text cleaning, token statistics, feature extraction (TF/TF-IDF), similarity, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and a live Reddit classifier.

> Data: the mini-project trains on a tiny local corpus (two folders: `data/machinelearning/`, `data/fishing/`) and then classifies live Reddit comments from those subreddits. No raw data is redistributed.
